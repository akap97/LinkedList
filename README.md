# LinkedList
Probles related to linked list

#### 1) AbsolutetoReal: Given a linked list L of N nodes, sorted in ascending order based on the absolute values of its data. Sort the linked list according to the actual values.

#### 2) addOne: Number is represented in linked list such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. Add 1 to it. For example 1999 is represented as (1-> 9-> 9 -> 9) and adding 1 to it should change it to (2->0->0->0).

#### 3) zigzag: Given a Linked list, rearrange it such that converted list should be of the form a < b > c < d > e < f .. where a, b, c are consecutive data node of linked list and such that the order of linked list is sustained.

#### 4) BinaryLinkedListtoDecimal: Given a singly linked list of 0s and 1s find its decimal equivalent.

#### 5) connectedComponenets: We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values. We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list. Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

#### 6) findMiddle: Given a linked list find its middle Node

#### 7) CountPairs: Given two linked list of size N1 and N2 respectively of distinct elements, your task is to complete the function countPairs(), which returns the count of all pairs from both lists whose sum is equal to the given value X.

#### 8) Even&Odd: Given a Linked List of integers, write a function to modify the linked list such that all even numbers appear before all the odd numbers in the modified linked list. Also, keep the order of even and odd numbers same.

#### 9) SortedMerge: Given two sorted linked lists consisting of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to merge both of the list (in-place) and return head of the merged list. Note: It is strongly recommended to do merging in-place using O(1) extra space.

#### 10) RemoveDuplicates: Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. If all the nodes in the linked list are equal, then remove n-1 nodes.

#### 11) Reverse: Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

#### 12) DetectLoop: Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

#### 13) NthFromEnd: Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

#### 14) CountLoop: Given a linked list of size N. The task is to complete the function countNodesinLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains a loop or not and if the loop is present then return the count of nodes in a loop or else return 0.

#### 15) SortedInsert: Given a sorted singly linked list and a data, your task is to insert the data in the linked list in a sorted way i.e. order of the list doesn't change.

#### 16)
